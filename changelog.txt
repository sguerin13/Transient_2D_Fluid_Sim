5-13:
 - updated the Stokes Transient Circle Script -> Renamed to Rev2
	- Variable reynolds number target: parameters save for viscosity are fixed. Improves stability and allows for better data generation
	- Increase sampling rate to 30 Hz -> also changed grid size to 60/120
	- Only keeping 10 seconds worth of frames -> 300 training samples per simulation

 - Updating Data Utils to add the ability to return the mask.
	- Also added new function to only return the Velocities, Densities, Reynolds #, SDF and the Mask.

 - Updating Data Prep to Use the Reynolds number scaler
	- param vec is going to be removed


5-15:
- created maskedloss module
- updated training routine
- created simulation scripts for triangles and rectangles
- updated trainer class
- modifying models to taking reynolds number a input
